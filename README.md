# Catholic Ride Share

A community-driven ride-sharing application connecting Catholics who need transportation to Mass, Confession, prayer events, and church social functions with volunteer drivers who are willing to help – especially in rural areas where distances can be long.

## Mission

To strengthen Catholic communities by ensuring that transportation is never a barrier to participating in the sacraments and church life.

> **📋 For Stakeholders**: If you're evaluating this project and have questions about risk, liability, or security, please see our comprehensive [Stakeholder Guide](docs/STAKEHOLDER_GUIDE.md) which addresses these concerns in detail.

## What We Are Building

At a high level, Catholic Ride Share is:

- A **volunteer ride network**: riders request help getting to church activities; drivers choose which rides they are willing to take.
- **Rural-friendly**: rides may be 10, 20, or more miles away; there is **no hard distance limit**. Distance is information, not a gate.
- **Privacy-conscious**: only the information needed to coordinate rides is stored; parish records only include **full name and address**, not Mass times or links that change frequently.
- **Donation-based**: riders can optionally offer donations after rides (via Stripe); there is no required payment for rides.
- **Admin-supported**: admins can verify drivers, monitor the system, and help resolve issues.

## Feature Overview

### Implemented (Backend foundation so far)

- **Authentication & accounts**
  - User registration with email and password.
  - JWT-based login (`access_token` + `refresh_token`).
  - Email verification with 6‑digit codes (required before using ride features).
  - Password reset flow with secure, single-use reset tokens.
- **User profiles**
  - Rider/driver/both/admin roles.
  - Basic profile data (name, phone, parish reference).
  - Optional profile photo upload (stored on S3, resized to 500×500 thumbnail).
- **Core data models**
  - `User` with optional last-known location (geospatial point).
  - `DriverProfile` for vehicle and driver status (verification fields to be extended).
  - `Parish` with **name + postal address + optional geospatial location** (no Mass times or URLs).
  - `RideRequest` and `Ride` models for requests and live rides.
- **Infrastructure**
  - Dockerized stack: FastAPI backend, Postgres + PostGIS, Redis, Celery worker.
  - Alembic migrations wired to the same settings as the app.

> Note: Many endpoints are still simple stubs; the backend structure is in place and being built out according to the strategic plan in `braingrid-improvements`.

### Planned (Under active development)

- **Driver experience**
  - Complete driver profile management (vehicle details, documents).
  - Multi-step verification workflow (background checks, safe environment, admin approval).
  - Availability (scheduled windows + “available now for X hours” sessions).
- **Rider experience**
  - Create ride requests with pickup + destination and optional parish reference.
  - Discover willing drivers, with distance shown but **no fixed 10‑mile limit**.
  - Real-time ride status updates from acceptance through completion/cancellation.
- **Messaging & notifications**
  - In-ride chat between rider and driver (WebSocket / Socket.IO).
  - Push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging) + email notifications.
- **Donations & reviews**
  - Post-ride rating and optional donations via Stripe.
  - Transparent handling of Stripe fees and net amounts.
- **Admin tools**
  - Admin endpoints for users, drivers, rides, and statistics.
  - Simple web/admin UI (future) to manage verifications and issues.
- **AI & assistance (future)**
  - AI-powered matching suggestions.
  - AI assistant for parish/ride questions (without storing or serving Mass times).
  - Multi-language support.

## API Endpoints

The backend is versioned under `/api/v1`. Some endpoints are fully implemented; others are present as stubs and will be expanded.

### Authentication (implemented)

- `POST /api/v1/auth/register`  
  Register a new user (creates an account and sends a verification email).

- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`  
  Login with email + password and receive access/refresh tokens.

- `POST /api/v1/auth/verify-email`  
  Verify email using a 6‑digit code sent to the user’s email.

- `POST /api/v1/auth/resend-verification`  
  Request that a new verification email be sent (idempotent-style behavior).

- `POST /api/v1/auth/forgot-password`  
  Initiate a password reset; always returns a generic success message and is rate-limited to prevent abuse and email enumeration.

- `POST /api/v1/auth/validate-reset-token`  
  Check whether a reset token is still valid.

- `POST /api/v1/auth/reset-password`  
  Reset a user’s password using a valid, single-use reset token.

### Users (implemented)

- `GET /api/v1/users/me`  
  Get the currently authenticated user’s profile.

- `PUT /api/v1/users/me`  
  Update the current user’s profile (name, phone, parish reference, etc.).

- `POST /api/v1/users/me/photo`  
  Upload or replace the current user’s profile photo (JPEG/PNG/WebP ≤ 5MB, stored in S3 as a 500×500 thumbnail).

- `DELETE /api/v1/users/me/photo`  
  Remove the current user’s profile photo (deletes the S3 object on a best-effort basis).

- `GET /api/v1/users/{user_id}`  
  Get another user’s public profile by ID (requires authentication).

### Rides, Drivers, Parishes (planned / partially stubbed)

These routes exist as placeholders and will be built out according to the strategic plan:

- `POST /api/v1/rides/` – Create ride request (planned: full request schema and matching).  
- `GET /api/v1/rides/` – List rides for the current user (planned).  
- `POST /api/v1/drivers/profile` – Create/update driver profile (planned).  
- `GET /api/v1/drivers/available` – Discover available/willing drivers nearby (planned; **no fixed distance limit**, distance used for ordering only).  
- `GET /api/v1/parishes/` – List parishes (full name + address only).  
- `GET /api/v1/parishes/{id}` – Get parish details (full name + address only).

## Roadmap

The detailed technical roadmap is maintained in the `braingrid-improvements` document and implemented in phases. In summary:

- **Foundation**: Core backend, authentication, email verification, password reset, and profile photos.  
- **Drivers & availability**: Driver profiles, verification, and availability (scheduled + “available now”).  
- **Rides & lifecycle**: Ride requests, matching based on willing drivers (not strict radius), ride status transitions, and cancellation rules.  
- **Messaging & notifications**: In-app messaging, push notifications, and email alerts.  
- **Donations & reviews**: Post-ride ratings and optional donations via Stripe.  
- **Parishes**: Simple parish records (name + address only) with geospatial search.  
- **Admin & analytics**: Admin APIs and dashboards for verification, issues, and high-level stats.  
- **Clients & AI**: Flutter mobile app, admin web UI, and AI-assisted matching/assistant.
