## 11. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Legal & Liability

**Q: Who is liable if there's an accident during a ride?**
A: The driver's personal auto insurance is the primary coverage. The platform's Terms of Service clarify that we act as a facilitator only. We're exploring supplemental coverage options and require all drivers to maintain adequate insurance.

**Q: Are drivers employees or independent contractors?**
A: Neither. Drivers are volunteers using the platform to coordinate charitable transportation services. There is no employment or contractor relationship.

**Q: What happens if a driver or rider violates the terms of service?**
A: Violations are reviewed by our team. Consequences range from warnings to temporary suspension to permanent bans, depending on severity. Users have a right to appeal.

### Safety & Security

**Q: How do you prevent bad actors from becoming drivers?**
A: Multi-layer verification including background checks, driving record checks, sex offender registry checks, Safe Environment training, insurance verification, and admin approval. Continuous monitoring and user ratings provide ongoing oversight.

**Q: What if I feel unsafe during a ride?**
A: Use the in-app emergency button to immediately contact authorities and platform support. Your live location is shared with emergency services. You can also contact our 24/7 safety line.

**Q: How is my personal data protected?**
A: Industry-standard encryption (TLS 1.3, AES-256), minimal data collection, regular security audits, and compliance with GDPR/CCPA. We never sell data to third parties.

### Financial

**Q: How much does it cost to use the platform?**
A: The platform is free to use. Riders can optionally offer donations to drivers after rides. Drivers can use the service at no cost (subject to their own vehicle/insurance costs).

**Q: Where do donation payments go?**
A: 100% of donations go to the driver, minus payment processing fees (typically 2.9% + $0.30 for Stripe). The platform takes no cut.

**Q: Is this a for-profit company?**
A: No. We're structured as an open-source community project and planning to become a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on serving the Catholic community.

### Operational

**Q: How do you ensure drivers are properly trained?**
A: All drivers must complete Safe Environment training (Virtus, CMGP, or equivalent) and acknowledge our safety guidelines. We provide additional resources and recommend (but don't require) first aid/CPR certification.

**Q: What if a driver can't complete a ride?**
A: Drivers should cancel with as much notice as possible. For emergencies, we have protocols to help find alternative transportation. Repeated unreliable behavior results in account review.

**Q: How far will drivers travel?**
A: There's no distance limit. Drivers see the distance before accepting and can choose based on their availability and willingness. Rural communities often require longer trips, and that's okay.
