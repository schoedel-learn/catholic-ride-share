## Development Setup

See README.md for detailed setup instructions.

Quick start:
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/catholic-ride-share
cd catholic-ride-share

# Set up backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Run with Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints
- Format with Black (line length 100)
- Sort imports with isort
- Maximum complexity: keep functions focused and small

### Git Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Reference issues and PRs when relevant

Example:
```
Add driver verification endpoint

- Implement document upload
- Add verification status tracking
- Create admin review interface

Closes #123
```

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Include both unit and integration tests

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_auth.py
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Update API documentation as needed
- Create or update docs/ files for architecture changes

## Review Process

1. Automated tests must pass
2. Code review by maintainer(s)
3. Changes requested if needed
4. Approval and merge

## Branch Protection

The `main` branch is protected with the following rules:

- **No force pushes**: Force pushes to main are disabled to preserve history
- **No deletion**: The main branch cannot be deleted
- **Required status checks**: All CI tests must pass before merging
- **Pull request reviews**: At least one approving review is required
- **Stale review dismissal**: Reviews are dismissed when new commits are pushed

These protections ensure code quality and prevent accidental or malicious changes to the production branch. All changes to `main` must go through pull requests.

Branch protection settings are documented in `.github/settings.yml`.
