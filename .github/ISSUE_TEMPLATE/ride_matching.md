## Matching Component

<!-- Which part of the ride matching system is this related to? -->

- [ ] Ride request creation
- [ ] Driver discovery/search
- [ ] Distance calculation (PostGIS)
- [ ] Availability windows
- [ ] "Available now" sessions
- [ ] Ride acceptance workflow
- [ ] Cancellation rules
- [ ] Other (describe below)

## Issue Description

<!-- A clear and concise description of the issue or improvement -->

## Current Matching Logic

<!-- Describe how rides are currently matched (if known) -->

## Proposed Improvement

<!-- Describe your suggested improvement -->

## Rural Consideration

<!-- How does this affect rural users with longer distances? -->

**Important:** This app has **no hard distance limit** - distance is information, not a gate. Rural Catholics may need rides 20+ miles away.

- [ ] This maintains flexibility for rural users
- [ ] This improves rural accessibility
- [ ] This may create distance limitations (explain why needed)

## Performance Impact

<!-- How might this affect system performance? -->

- [ ] No performance impact
- [ ] May increase database queries
- [ ] May require caching strategy
- [ ] Needs testing with large datasets

## AI/ML Consideration

<!-- Could AI/ML improve this matching scenario? -->

- [ ] Yes, AI could help (describe)
- [ ] No, rule-based logic is sufficient
- [ ] Maybe, needs further analysis

## User Experience

<!-- How does this affect the user experience? -->

**For Drivers:**
<!-- Describe impact on drivers -->

**For Riders:**
<!-- Describe impact on riders -->

## Edge Cases

<!-- What unusual scenarios should be considered? -->

1. 
2. 
3. 

## Additional Context

<!-- Add any other context, mockups, or data -->
